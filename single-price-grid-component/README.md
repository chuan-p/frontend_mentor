## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Never written any serious CSS project before so this is my first, which helps me acknowledge how fucked up CSS actually is lol.


### Continued development

Might clean the code later (or never, probably).

### Useful resources

- [The Odin Project's CSS Grid Tutorial](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/html-and-css/lessons/grid) - I learned how to use CSS Grid here.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
